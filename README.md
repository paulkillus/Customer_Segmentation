# Customer_Segmentation with Python
Customer Segmentation - Cohort Analysis, RFM Analysis, K-means clustering for a online retail dataset  

This is a re-work notebook after I took the "Customer Segmentation in Python" course on DataCamp. However, I use a different dataset - "online retail II" from UCI open datasets.  

This notebook includes:

1. A cohort analysys
2. RFM Segmentation
3. Customer Segmentation with K-means clustering
